nerfview is a minimal\* web viewer for interactive NeRF rendering. It is largely
inspired by [nerfstudio's
viewer](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio), but with a
standalone packaging and simple API to quickly integrate into your own research
projects.

\*The whole package contains two files and is less than 400 lines of code.

## Installation

This package requires Python 3.8+.

For existing project, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install nerfview
```

To run our examples, you can clone this repository and then install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfview
# Install torch first.
pip install torch
# Then this repo and dependencies for running examples. Note that `gsplat`
# requires compilation and this will take some time for the first time.
pip install -e .
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

nerfview is built on [viser](https://viser.studio/latest/) and provides a
simple API for interactive viewing.

The canonical usage is as follows:

```python
from typing import Tuple

import viser
import nerfview


def render_fn(
    camera_state: nerfview.CameraState, render_tab_state: nerfview.RenderTabState
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Parse camera state for camera-to-world matrix (c2w) and intrinsic (K) as
    # float64 numpy arrays.
    if render_tab_state.preview_render:
        width = render_tab_state.render_width
        height = render_tab_state.render_height
    else:
        width = render_tab_state.viewer_width
        height = render_tab_state.viewer_height

    c2w = camera_state.c2w
    K = camera_state.get_K([width, height])
    # Do your things and get an image as a uint8 numpy array.
    img = your_rendering_logic(...)
    return img

# Initialize a viser server and our viewer.
server = viser.ViserServer(verbose=False)
viewer = nerfview.Viewer(server=server, render_fn=render_fn, mode='rendering')
```

It will start a viser server and render the image from a camera that you can interact with.

## Examples

We provide a few examples ranging from toy rendering to real-world NeRF training
applications. Click on the dropdown to see more details. You can always ask for

This example showcases how to interactively render a mesh by directly serving
rendering results from <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/nvdiffrast/">nvdiffrast</a>.

```bash
# Only need to run once the first time.
bash examples/assets/download_dragon_mesh.sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python examples/02_mesh_rendering.py

This example showcases how to render a pretrained 3DGS model using gsplat. The
scene is cropped such that it is smaller to download. It is essentially the
[simple viewer
example](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat/blob/07d9188590ae1ee1e9ff7794a4217cc4591b44cf/examples/simple_viewer.py),
which we include here to be self-contained.

```bash
# Only need to run once the first time.
bash examples/assets/download_gsplat_ckpt.sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python examples/03_gsplat_rendering.py \
    --ckpt examples/assets/ckpt_6999_crop.pt

scene using gsplat. It is essentially the [simple trainer
